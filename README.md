## üìÅ **HTML & CSS**

This section includes projects where I built the foundational elements of web development using **HTML** and **CSS**. The focus was on creating structured, responsive, and visually appealing websites.

- **HTML & CSS Basics**  
  Built static web pages using semantic HTML and applied styling through CSS.
  
- **Responsive Web Design**  
  Used **media queries** to make websites adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
  
- **Layout Techniques**  
  Developed modern web layouts with tools like **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**.

## üìÅ **JavaScript**

JavaScript is at the core of creating dynamic, interactive websites. In this section, I explored essential and advanced JS concepts to enhance website functionality.

- **Core JavaScript Concepts**  
  Implemented functions, loops, and conditionals to create interactive elements.
  
- **DOM Manipulation**  
  Utilized the **Document Object Model** (DOM) to update and interact with web pages dynamically.
  
- **Event Handling**  
  Created responsive web pages by listening to and handling user input and events.

## üìÅ **C#**

This section focuses on **C#**, a powerful language for building a wide range of applications. I‚Äôve mastered key concepts such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, advanced language features, and best practices for writing clean, efficient code.

### Key Concepts and Skills:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  - **Classes & Objects**: Encapsulated data and functionality into reusable classes.
  - **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: Built flexible systems with inheritance and method overriding.
  - **Encapsulation**: Managed data access with access modifiers (`private`, `public`).

- **Advanced Features**  
  - **LINQ**: Simplified data queries with **Language Integrated Query**.
  - **Delegates & Events**: Created event-driven systems using delegates and events.
  - **Asynchronous Programming**: Used **async** and **await** for efficient, non-blocking code.

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
  - Worked with **arrays**, **lists**, **dictionaries**, **stacks**, and **queues**.
  - Implemented **sorting** and **searching algorithms** like **QuickSort** and **Binary Search**.

- **Exception Handling & Debugging**  
  - Utilized **try-catch-finally** for error handling and created custom exceptions.
  - Used **debugging tools** to identify and fix issues in applications.

- **File I/O & Serialization**  
  - Handled file operations with **StreamReader/StreamWriter** and serialized data in **JSON** and **XML** formats.

- **Unit Testing**  
  - Wrote unit tests using **NUnit** and followed **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** practices.

- **Design Patterns**  
  - Implemented design patterns like **Singleton**, **Factory**, and **Observer** for scalable application architecture.

### Projects and Applications:

I‚Äôve applied these skills by building real-world projects such as:

- **Console Applications**: Practiced algorithms and C# fundamentals.
- **Desktop Applications**: Developed **Windows Forms** and **WPF** apps.
- **Web Applications**: Created dynamic **ASP.NET Core** web apps.

## üìÅ **SQL & Entity Framework**

Here, I gained proficiency in working with relational databases using **SQL** and **Entity Framework**. This section demonstrates my ability to interact with databases and integrate them into C# applications.

- **SQL Queries**  
  Wrote SQL queries for various data manipulation tasks, including **SELECT**, **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE**.
  
- **Entity Framework**  
  Used **Entity Framework** for database interaction, automating CRUD operations and simplifying data management in C#.
